# Private Events - Ruby on Rails

This is an app that allows users to sign up and create events with titles, description, location, and dates that allows other users to RSVP to. It uses the "devise" gem to handle user authentication and registration. This project demonstrates using many to many relationships and multiple relations with the same models.
